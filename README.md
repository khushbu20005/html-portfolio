# html-portfolio
This is my beginner-friendly personal portfolio built using only HTML. It highlights who I am, my current learning path, and serves as a foundation for future updates. I will continue to improve and update this project as I learn CSS, JavaScript, responsiveness, and modern web development techniques.
